 This game will test your reflexes to
 the utmost with superfast action and
 awesome graphics (yeah, right).  The
 idea of the game is basically to hit
 the little red ball from one side of
 the net to the other.  Keep doing it
 until you drop the ball.

   The control keystrokes are:

#1 Left arrow  / A / Z / 4 #3: Move left
#1 Right arrow / D / X / 6 #3: Move right
#1       F1 / H / ? #3: This screen
#1        Escape / Q #3: Quit game


#2        Now, back to the game...
